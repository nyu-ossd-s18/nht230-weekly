My name is Natalie Totonchy and I'm from Boston, Massachusetts. This is my last semester at NYU and I am hoping to graduate this May with a degree in Computer Science and a minor in Business Studies. My hobbies include: boxing, playing piano, singing, and reading classics like Jane Austen's Pride and Pejudice or Voltaire's Candide.

### More Information

I am very excited to take this open source class because it is an area of software development that I have not yet explored and I am eager to see what kind of contributions I can make to projects around the world!
