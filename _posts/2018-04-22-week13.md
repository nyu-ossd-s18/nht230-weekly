### Final Reflection:

I really enjoyed this course and have learned so much about open source software philosophy and development. Before this course, I thought that open source software meant free software. Taking this course I have learned that the purpose of making software open source has so many benefits for the users of that software as well as the creators. I really enjoyed navigating an open source project and getting to experience interacting with an open source community. I realy enjoyed the project that we worked on for the second half of the semester. I feel that it gave us a good chance to be exposed to open source development by getting our hands dirty so to speak. If there was one thing I would add to the course I would maybe add a lecture on using/navigating GitHub for those students that have not used the platform before this class.
