### Team Project Progress

This week our team has begun to finish up our work with the Zulip project. Each group member has either contributed to an issue or is currently working on as issue. Individually, this week I had to go back and make a new pull request because a member of Zulip commented on my request saying that my fix got rid of a feature he enjoyed. I created an entirely new pull request to fix the issue specifically how the lead developed Tim Abbott and this member of the community requested it. My pull request then got merged the next day.
