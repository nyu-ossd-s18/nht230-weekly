### Team Project Report

Our team has been claiming issues from the Zulip issue list and has been working to make commits and solve some of these issues. Two of our group members have submitted pull requests for two separate issues. I have been working to solve the two issues that I claimed from the Zulip issue list with the help of my group members. One of the issues involves creating a new design for the keyboard shortcuts and the other issue has to do with fixing reactivating users. I am currently still attempting to find fixes.
