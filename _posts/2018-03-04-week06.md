### What are the strenghts and weaknesses of the team in terms of being able to participate in the project you selected?

Some of our strengths is that we know Python, HTML, and CSS.
Personally I am not very advanced in Python, but I know HTML and CSS.
A weakness for me is that I do not know Javascript. Neither does Nadira, but Adnan and Emilio know it.
