### Group Project:

Our group found closed issues to look at to get a better idea of the kind of fixes and problems there were. We also collected issues that we could potentiall work on. The group met on Tuesday to begin working on some of the issues that we had identified previously. The group attempted to solve issue #8750 but ran into some trouble and is still working on figuring it out.
