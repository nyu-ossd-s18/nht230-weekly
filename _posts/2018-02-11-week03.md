### How I selected the article:

I was not sure what article to contribute to since there are an overwhelming amount of topics on Wikipedia and it is difficult to find something I think I know enough about that hasn't already been heavily contributed to. So I decided to edit one of Wikipedia's suggested articles that require help. I chose to edit the Social Welfare in Mexico page, which Wikipedia said needed to be edited for "style and tone".

### Contribution that I made:

I edited each section of the article for clarity and rearranged certain sentences, moving parts around to different sections to help the flow of the article. The article originally did not read very well, containing choppy sentences and fragmented thoughts.
